    "<ul>The M5 Competition dataset came from Walmart.  The dataset was composed of daily sales informationo for each product item, at each store location.

These information can help in improving the accuracy of the forecast.  These information includes sell prices, promotions, days of the week, and special events like major sport events (ex. Super Bowl), special days (ex. Valentine’s Day) and holidays (ex. Orthodox Easter).\n",

    "<ul>The M5 Competition had two-tracks competition that used the same data set.  The first was a forecast accuracy competiton and the second was a forecast uncertianty distribution competition.  For the forecast accuracy, the participants were asked to provide 28 days forecast. For the uncertainty distribution, the participants were asked to provide 28 days ahead of probabilistic forecast for the median and for 50%, 67%, 95% and 99% predication intervals.</ul>\n",

    "Based on the learnings from previous M Competitions, M5 used a modified Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) that was originally proposed by  by Hydman and Koeler as another way to measure forecasting accuracy.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<i>“The M5 “Accuracy” competition utilized a variant of the MASE originally proposed by Hyndman and Koehler (2006) called the root mean squared scaled error (RMSSE), which is defined as follows:</i>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "<ul><h1>RMSSE = $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{h}\\sum_{t=n+1}^{n+h} ( y_{t} - \\hat{y}_{t} )^2}{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{t=2}^{n} (y_{t} - \\hat{y}_{t-1} )^2}}    .$</h1></ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<i><br>where <b> $y_{t}$ </b> is the actual future value of the examined time series at point <b> t, $\\hat{y}_{t}$ </b> is the forecast by the method under evaluation, <b> n </b> is the length of the training sample (number of historical observations), and <b> h </b> is the forecasting horizon (28 days). It should be noted that the denominator of RMSSE (in-sample, one-step-ahead mean squared error of the naive method) is computed only for the periods during which the examined products are actively sold, i.e., the periods following the first non-zero demand observed for the series under evaluation, because many of the products included in the data set started to be sold later than the first available date\"</i> (Makridakis et al., 2022).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<i>“Similar to MASE, RMSSE is independent of the data scale and it has predictable behavior, i.e., it becomes infinite or undefined only when all the errors with the Naive method are equal to zero, as well as having a defined mean and finite variance, and it is symmetric in the sense that it penalizes equally positive and negative forecast errors. The choice of this particular measure can also be justified as follows.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Many of the series in the competition are characterized by intermittency, involving sporadic unit sales with many zeros. Thus, absolute errors that are optimized for the median (Schwertman et al., 1990) would assign lower scores (better accuracy) to forecasting methods that derive forecasts close to zero. However, the objective of the competition is to accurately forecast the average sales. Thus, the accuracy measure employed is built on squared errors that are optimized for the mean (Kolassa, 2016). In contrast to other measures with similar statistical properties, such as relative errors and measures (Davydenko & Fildes, 2013), RMSSE can be safely computed for all M5 series because it does not rely on divisions with values that could be equal or close to zero. For example, this is typically the case with percentage errors when  is equal to zero or relative errors when the error of the benchmark used for scaling is zero”</i> (Makridakis et al., 2022).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<i>“After estimating RMSSE for all 42,840 time-series in the competition (the average accuracy reported for each series across the complete forecasting horizon), the overall accuracy of the forecasting method was computed by averaging the RMSSE scores across all series in the data set using appropriate weights. This measure, called the weighted RMSSE (WRMSSE), is defined as follows:</i>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <h2>WRMSSE = $ \\sum_{i=1}^{42,840} w_{i} x RMSSE_{i} $ </h2>\n",
    "    \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<i>where <b>$w_{i}$</b> is the weight and <b>$RMSSE_{i}$</b> is the score of the ith series in the competition. Lower WRMSSE scores indicate more accurate forecasts. It should be noted that the estimation of WRMSSE differs from the approaches applied in previous M competitions. In the first three competitions, all of the errors were computed both per series and per forecasting horizon, and then equally averaged together. In M4, the errors were first averaged per series in exactly the same manner as M5, but then averaged again using equal weights.\n",
    "<br><br>The weights for the WRMSSE measure were computed based on the last 28 observations of the final training sample in the data set, specifically the cumulative actual dollar sales in each series in that particular period (sum of units sold multiplied by their respective price)”</i>  (Makridakis et al., 2022).\n",

It will very interesting to see whether ML methods continue to dominate statistical methods in the future, particularly for other types of data that are not exclusively related to hierarchical retail sales applications.\n",
